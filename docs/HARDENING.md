# Hardening — real-input gap log

Systematic robustness pass: feed partitura complicated real-world scores from
many sources (Guitar Pro, MusicXML, MIDI, …), parse + render them, and record
every gap found so they can be closed one at a time.

The guiding principle: **the renderer must never crash on real input** — an
unrecognized or malformed element should be skipped (ideally logged), not throw.

## Corpus swept so far

| Source | Files | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Guitar Pro (`.gp3/4/5/.gp/.gpx`, in-repo) | 25 | all parse + render (notation & tab) ✅ |
| MusicXML real scores (OSMD corpus: Bach, Beethoven, Mozart quartet/quintet, Brahms, Debussy, Clementi, 1.2 MB orchestral, `.mxl`) | 12 | 9 render ✅, 1 parse-fail, 2 render-crash |
| MIDI (round-trip of the above) | 3 | all parse + render ✅ |
| MEI real scores (Aguado guitar, Altenburg concerto 431 KB, Bach **Brandenburg** 1.2 MB, fughette) | 4 | all parse + render ✅ (single-part path) |
| Humdrum `**kern` (Bach chorales) | 2 | all parse + render ✅ |
| **C6 multi-part probe** (via `staffSystemFromMusicXml`) | 10 | Mozart quartet → 4 staves, Beethoven/Debussy → 3, Bach/Clementi → 2, **ActorPrelude orchestral → 23 staves / 2377 elements** ✅ (all after G6/G7) |
| **Round 4** — 10 more each: MusicXML (Gounod 7-staff, Haydn, Mozart songs), MEI (Brandenburg II/III/IV, Chopin, chorales), `**kern` (10 Bach chorales → 4-part SATB) | 30 | all parse + render ✅; multi-part probe 19/20 (1 `.mxl` = probe artifact) |
| **Round 4** — MIDI + ABC round-trips of the real XMLs | 10 + 10 | MIDI all ✅; **3 ABC (vocal) rendered a crash → G8** |
| **Round 5** — end-to-end **CLI `render` sweep** of the whole corpus (XML + MEI + kern) through the newly-wired multi-part path | 19 | 17 render ✅ (incl. MEI now multi-part: Altenburg → 8, **Brandenburg → 9**), **1 tab MusicXML crash → G9**, 1 corpus artifact (`chor150.krn` = a 0-byte "404: Not Found" failed download; rejecting it is correct) |
| **Round 6** — fresh OSMD batch (Gounod, Haydn, Joplin, Telemann, Schumann, …) swept via CLI render | 14 | 13 render ✅, **1 UTF-16 crash → G10** |
| **Round 7** — **oracle differential vs music21** over MEI (14) + new music-encoding MEI (7: Musikalisches Opfer, Beethoven quartet Op18, Hymn to Joy, …) | 21 | found + fixed **G14** (beamed notes dropped) & **G15** (only first section read); MEI oracle 0/14 → **10/14 exact**, new batch captures 100% of music21's notes (Beethoven quartet 4151, Musikalisches Opfer 850) |
| **Round 8** — grace-note fix + fresh OSMD MusicXML batch (Joplin Elite Syncopations, Telemann Allegro, Clementi, Saltarello) via oracle | 6 | 5/6 exact (Joplin 1388, Telemann 911 notes); only ActorPrelude diverges (G13, by design). MusicXML importer stays essentially correct. |
| **Round 9** — close **G12**: multi-voice export for kern (`*^` split) + ABC (`&` overlay), writer + reader | — | kern round-trip 89% → **100%**, ABC 90% → **97%**; corpus round-trip sweep now 100% for MusicXML/MEI/MuseScore/kern |
| **Round 10** — 54 more music-encoding MEI (Brahms, Hummel, Liszt, Ravel, Webern, jazz…) via oracle → **G17 voice-aware tuplets** (`TupletSpan.voice`, per-voice `effectiveDurationAt`, `<tupletSpan>` resolved by note ownership not `@staff`) | 54 | Hummel 20392-note concerto, Liszt, Borodin trio, Brahms & Weber quartets → 100%; MEI oracle 0/14 (start) → **54/69** across 75 files. Residual: Schumann cello + inner-voice tuplet bracket glyphs. |
| **Round 11** — real **KernScores** piano (Chopin mazurkas, Mozart sonatas) via oracle | 8 | 0/8 exact — **found G18**: multi-staff kern `*^` column-shift drops ~half the notes on piano scores (2 spines + splits). Confirmed pitch-level (partitura 46-89% of music21). Top priority for the next kern-reader pass. |

## Round-trip fidelity (import ↔ export)

Beyond "does it crash?", we measure **how much survives** a write-then-read
round-trip — this exercises the importer *and* the exporter together and
quantifies parse fidelity. Two harnesses:

* `test/roundtrip_fidelity_test.dart` — committed, self-contained: feature-probe
  scores (stepwise, chords+rests, dotted+ties, accidentals, wide range) through
  every round-trippable format. Notation formats are held to the **full notated
  content** (pitch, rhythm, enharmonic spelling, clef, key, meter); MIDI only to
  **sounding content sampled over time** (it legitimately re-notates rhythm and
  can't encode a trailing rest). 30 cases green.
* `tool/roundtrip_sweep.dart` — diagnostic over the real corpus at
  `/Volumes/backups/ai/partitura-corpus`; compares the note multiset
  `(sorted-MIDI, duration)` across all voices. Latest run (79 imported scores):

  | format | exact | avg note-preserved |
  |---|---|---|
  | MusicXML | 100% (92/92) | 100.0% |
  | MEI | 100% (92/92) | 100.0% |
  | MuseScore | 100% (92/92) | 100.0% |
  | kern | 100% (92/92) | 100.0% |
  | ABC | 100% (92/92) | 100.0% |
  | MIDI | 28% (26/92) | 89.4% |

  (These numbers count **all four voices** — an earlier version of the sweep read
  only voice 1 and so reported a misleading kern/ABC 100%.) kern and ABC
  now round-trip all voices too — the kern writer splits the spine (`*^`) and
  the ABC writer emits `&` overlays (G12 fixed). ABC's 97% residual is G11
  resolved too (it was a key-change accidental bug, G11 — not broken
  rhythm): every notation format now round-trips at **100%**. MusicXML / MEI /
  MuseScore preserve every voice. MIDI's lower "exact" is **expected** — the multiset key includes duration, and
  MIDI re-notates dotted/tied rhythm; the committed test's sampled-sounding
  metric confirms MIDI keeps what sounds. A round-trip only proves reader+writer
  are **mutually consistent**; the external oracle (`tool/oracle_diff.*`) tests
  **correctness** against an independent parser.

## External oracle (differential vs music21)

`tool/oracle_dump.py` (music21) + `tool/oracle_diff.dart` parse the *same* file
two ways and compare the note multiset `(midi, tuplet-scaled quarterLength)`
across **all** parts (partitura via the multi-part `staffSystemFrom*`, to line
up with music21's all-parts flatten). This catches bugs a round-trip can't — a
reader+writer that are wrong in the *same* way round-trip cleanly. music21 is
"trusted" only as a mature independent parser; a confirmed divergence is
investigated, not blindly blamed on partitura.

Latest sweep — **45/47 MusicXML+kern scores agree exactly** (all 12 Bach kern
chorales; Mozart quartet + Clarinet Quintet; Clementi; Telemann; Schubert;
Debussy; Dichterliebe; Gounod; Haydn; the lieder — every multi-voice piano
score). partitura's importer is, on this corpus, essentially correct.

**Two rounds of "divergences" turned out to be bugs in the oracle *tool*, not in
partitura** — a live demonstration of the user's caution that the oracle script
`s` can be the buggy one:
1. It first compared the *nominal* notated duration, flagging every triplet
   (Mozart AnChloe / Clarinet Quintet). Fixed to use `effectiveDurationAt`
   (tuplet-scaled).
2. It then counted only voice 1 (`measure.elements`), ignoring the model's
   `voice2/voice3/voice4` — so it mis-reported every multi-voice piano score as
   "partitura dropped notes." Fixed to read all four voices. This collapsed the
   apparent gap from 14 scores to 2, and confirmed the importer *does* capture
   inner voices (Dichterliebe: 410 of music21's 411 notes).

The **2 genuine residuals**: `Voice_Alignment` (a synthetic 5-voice test — the
model caps at 4 voices/staff, so 2 notes shift) and `ActorPrelude` (~244 notes with irregular un-typed durations are
*snapped* to the nearest notatable value per G6, vs music21's exact fractional
quarterLength — a deliberate trade-off, not a parse error). See G12 / G13.

**Extending the oracle to the MEI corpus (14 files) then paid off big** — it
found two *real* MEI-reader bugs (not tool artifacts this time), now fixed:
0/14 → **10/14 exact** (G14 beams, G15 sections); a follow-up grace-note
fix (G16) then reached **16/20** across the expanded MEI corpus. The residual
over-reads are benign (repeat endings / enharmonic spelling).

## Gaps

| # | Severity | Area | Symptom | Repro | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | medium | CLI packaging | `render` to SVG failed *"SMuFL metadata not found"* when the CLI binary ran outside the repo tree — so the **released standalone binary** couldn't render without `--metadata`. | `partitura render x.musicxml x.svg` from `/tmp` | **fixed** — Bravura metadata embedded (deflate+base64, ~136 KB) as an offline fallback |
| G2 | high (fidelity) | reader / model | Multi-part scores collapsed to a **single part** through the single-`Score` path. | `partitura info Mozart_String_Quartet…` → 1 clef | **fixed by C6 + CLI wiring**: `staffSystemFromMusicXml` + `layoutMultiPartPages` import & paginate all parts. The **CLI `render`** now auto-detects a multi-part input, wraps it into line-broken systems (`layoutStaffSystemSystems` → `staffSystemSystemsToSvg`) and draws every staff with shared systemic barlines. Verified: Mozart quartet → 4 staves, ActorPrelude orchestral → **23 staves / 5379 glyphs**, Bach chorale kern → 4 (SATB), Clementi → 2. `--single` forces the old one-part path; `--width` / `--hide-empty` tune the wrap. |
| G6 | high | musicxml reader | The orchestral **ActorPrelude** threw `Cannot map duration 85/1024` — a `<duration>` with no `<type>` that doesn't reduce to a standard value aborted the import. | multi-part import of `ActorPreludeSample.xml` | **fixed** — snaps to the nearest note value |
| G7 | high | musicxml reader | A percussion `<unpitched>` note (no `<pitch>`, no `<rest>`) threw `<note> without <pitch> or <rest>`, aborting the import (orchestral scores). | same file, after G6 | **fixed** — `<unpitched>` maps to its display staff line (proper percussion staff is a tracked follow-up) |
| G8 | high (crash) | **abc reader** | A vocal ABC round-trip threw `RangeError` in `_layoutLyrics`. **Root cause** (not the layout): the reader added *rest* ids to `noteOrder`, so `w:` syllables aligned onto rests — shifting every syllable and attaching some past the last note. | round-trip render of Mozart AnChloe / DasVeilchen / Land der Berge | **fixed at the source** — `noteOrder` now holds note ids only, so syllables align to notes and skip rests (per the ABC spec). Regression test pins it. |
| G3 | high | musicxml reader | A slur `start`/`stop` imbalance (a `type="continue"` reusing a number, or a lost `stop`) left a slur open → parse aborted *"Unclosed `<slur>`"*. | `partitura info Debussy_Mandoline.xml` | **fixed** — dangling slur dropped, parse continues |
| G4 | high (crash) | layout engine | A degenerate `Hairpin(eN → eN)` (start == end) threw `must run forward in reading order` — uncaught. | `partitura render Dichterliebe01.xml …` | **fixed** (a2… ) |
| G5 | high (crash) | layout engine | A `Pedal(e0 → e29)` whose end id is not in the imported score threw `references an unknown note element id` — uncaught. | `partitura render OSMD_Function_Test_Pedals.musicxml …` | **fixed** |
| G9 | high (crash) | musicxml reader | A **guitar-tablature** MusicXML staff carries `<clef><sign>TAB</sign>`, which `_clefOf` didn't recognize → threw `Unsupported clef: TAB5`, aborting the whole import. | `partitura render BrookeWestSample.mxl …` | **fixed at the source** — `TAB` maps to the guitar clef (`treble8vb`, sounding 8vb) so the staff's real `<pitch>`es render; any other/malformed sign now defaults to treble instead of aborting (reader-leniency, per G3/G6/G7). BrookeWest → 2 staves. Regression test in `musicxml_test.dart`. |
| G10 | high (crash) | CLI file read | A **UTF-16 LE (BOM)** MusicXML — a legal, common export encoding, its XML prolog even declaring `encoding="UTF-16"` — threw `FileSystemException: Failed to decode data using encoding 'utf-8'` because the CLI read every text score via `File.readAsStringSync` (UTF-8 only). | `partitura render test_UTF16LEBOM_decoding_nested_tuplet.musicxml …` | **fixed at the byte→String boundary** — a `_readText` helper sniffs the BOM (UTF-16 LE/BE, UTF-8) and decodes accordingly (`dart:convert` ships no UTF-16 codec); all text-format reads route through it. CLI round-trip test in `cli_test.dart`. |
| G11 | low (rhythm fidelity) | abc writer/reader | An ABC round-trip of a dense syncopated ragtime (Joplin *The Entertainer*) preserves **every pitch, note and measure** (520 notes / 955 pitches / 92 bars identical) but re-encodes a handful of sub-beat **durations** (some 1/16 / dotted-1/16 in broken rhythm come back as a different value). Found by `tool/roundtrip_sweep.dart` (99.9% note-preserved). | round-trip of `ScottJoplin_The_Entertainer.xml` through ABC | **fixed** — two ABC accidental bugs: the writer computed accidentals against the *initial* key, so after a mid-tune `[K:…]` change a note the new key alters (E under 2 flats) was written bare and read a semitone off; and the reader carried voice-1 accidentals across a `&` overlay. Both fixed; ABC round-trip **90% → 100%** (Joplin *Entertainer*/*Elite Syncopations* now exact). `abc_test.dart`. |
| G12 | medium (export fidelity) | **kern / abc writers** | The kern and ABC **writers are single-voice subset codecs** — they emit only voice 1 and silently drop `voice2/3/4`, so a multi-voice score loses its inner voices on export (round-trip 90%, the loss exactly equals the voice2-4 note count: Bach *Ein feste Burg* 38/38, Ahle 40/40, Haydn 55/65). **Import is fine** — the model + all readers (MusicXML/MEI/MuseScore) carry four voices, verified 100% by the oracle. *(This gap was originally mis-logged as an importer bug; that was the oracle tool reading only voice 1 — corrected.)* Separately, the model caps at **4 voices/staff**, so `Voice_Alignment`'s 5th voice shifts (synthetic, 2 notes). | round-trip of `Bach-JS_Ein_feste_Burg.mei` through kern/ABC | **open** — kern needs spine-split (`*^`/`*v`) multi-voice output; ABC needs `V:`/`&` polyphony. Both are real features (the writers document themselves as single-spine). Model's 4-voice cap is a separate, low-value extension. **FIXED** — the ABC writer now emits inner voices as `&` overlays and the reader parses them into voice2/3/4; the kern writer splits the spine (`*^` … `*v *v`) with the voices time-merged and the reader tracks the split into voice2. Round-trip: **kern 89% → 100%, ABC 90% → 97%** (the ABC residual is G11 broken-rhythm durations, not voices — voice3-4 = 0 in every remaining case). Regression tests in `abc_test.dart` / `kern_test.dart`. Remaining edges: voices 3-4 in kern, multi-staff intra-voice (rare). |
| G13 | low (by design) | musicxml reader (duration snapping) | The orchestral **ActorPrelude** is the one MusicXML score that still diverges from music21 (95.7%): partitura keeps the 14 `<tremolo type="single">` correctly as marks (no expansion), but ~244 notes with **irregular `<duration>` values and no `<type>`** (e.g. 85/1024 — the G6 case) are **snapped to the nearest notatable value** (a dotted-64th, ql 0.094), whereas music21 keeps the exact fractional quarterLength. | `dart run tool/oracle_diff.dart ActorPreludeSample.xml` → 244 notes at ql 0.094 | **by design** — the G6 snap-to-nearest is what stops these un-typed fine durations from aborting the import; the trade-off is a small rhythmic rounding vs music21. Not a parse error. *(Earlier mislabelled as tremolo expansion — corrected after checking: only 14 notes carry a tremolo mark, none are expanded.)* |
| G14 | high (fidelity) | **mei reader** | MEI wraps beamed notes in `<beam>` containers; the layer reader handled `note/chord/rest/tuplet` but let `<beam>` fall through `default`, so **every beamed note was dropped**. Baroque scores are ~90% beamed — a Brandenburg movement read 758 of 9140 notes (8.3%). Found by the music21 oracle over the MEI corpus. | `dart run tool/oracle_diff.dart Bach-JS_BrandenburgConcert_No2_I_BWV1047.mei` → 8.3% | **fixed** — `_flattenBeams` unwraps `<beam>` (recursively; also inside `<tuplet>`) so its children join the sequence. Brandenburg I now 9140/9140 exact. Regression tests in `mei_test.dart`. |
| G15 | high (fidelity) | **mei reader** | The reader read only the **first** `<section>` of a score (`score.child('section')`), dropping every later section — a chorale with one section per verse kept 4 of 18 measures. | `dart run tool/oracle_diff.dart Altenburg_Macht_auf_die_Tor.mei` → 23% | **fixed** — gather measures from *all* `<section>`s (recursing through nested sections / repeat `<ending>`s) in document order. MEI oracle 0/14 → 10/14 exact after G14+G15. Regression test in `mei_test.dart`. |
| G16 | medium (fidelity) | **mei reader** | Grace notes (`<note grace="acc\|unacc">`) were read as **full-duration notes**, over-filling the bar and inflating the note count (the MusicXML reader already folds them). Found as a consistent small over-read across grace-heavy MEI (Beethoven quartet +30, Musikalisches Opfer +53). | `dart run tool/oracle_diff.dart Beethoven_StringQuartet_Op18_No1.mei` → +30 partitura-only | **fixed** — grace `<note>`/`<chord>` accumulate as `graceNotes` on the following principal note (acc→appoggiatura, unacc→acciaccatura), matching the MusicXML reader. MEI oracle 10/14 → **16/20** exact; the residual over-reads (Altenburg, Chopin) are repeat-ending / enharmonic, benign. `mei_test.dart`. |
| G17 | high (fidelity) | **mei reader** | Tuplets encoded as a `<tupletSpan startid endid num numbase>` **control event** (referencing the first/last note by id) — how professionally-encoded MEI marks most tuplets — were ignored, so the notes kept their nominal (unscaled) duration. The oracle showed pitch-perfect but duration-divergent scores: Hummel trumpet concerto 88% (20392 notes), Brahms quartet 95%, Liszt 92%. | `dart run tool/oracle_diff.dart Hummel_Concerto_for_trumpet_E-major.mei` → 2410/2410 duration-only | **fixed** — `<tupletSpan>`s are collected per measure, resolved by note id to voice-1 index ranges, and applied as `TupletSpan`s. Hummel & Liszt → 100%, Brahms → 99%. MEI oracle over the expanded 75-file corpus 51/69 exact. Residual: tuplets in voices 2-4 (the model carries tuplets on voice 1 only). `mei_test.dart`. |
| G18 | high (fidelity) | **kern reader** | Multi-staff kern (piano: 2 `**kern` spines, often + a `**dynam` spine) uses per-spine **sub-spine splits** (`*^`). When a *left* spine splits, every spine to its right shifts one column — but the reader tracks each staff at a **fixed** starting column and only follows splits within its *own* spine, so after a left split it reads the wrong column and **drops ~half the notes**. Found by the music21 oracle on real Chopin mazurkas / Mozart sonatas: partitura 411 vs music21 896 notes (46%). Single-staff `scoreFromKern` (no left neighbour) is unaffected. | `dart run tool/oracle_diff.dart chopin-mazurkas_mazurka06-1.krn` → 75%, 411/896 | **open (top priority)** — needs proper Humdrum spine arithmetic: track the global spine tree (`*^` duplicates a slot, `*v *v` merges, non-kern spines interleave) so each staff maps to its *current* columns per line. A focused rewrite of `staffSystemFromKern` / `_KernReader` column handling; single-staff path stays as-is. |

### G4 + G5 — fixed, and generalized
Root cause: **every** span/annotation layout pass threw on a degenerate span
(start == end / reversed) or a dangling note id. Any span whose other end is in a
dropped part (very common — see G2) crashed the whole render. Fix: **all** of the
~20 span passes (dynamics, hairpins, pedals, slurs, glissandos, portamentos,
laissez-vibrer, ottavas, trills, vibratos, lyrics, figured bass, breath marks,
jazz marks, chord diagrams) now **skip** a degenerate/dangling span and render
everything else — a renderer must never crash on real input. The
"fails-loudly" tests were updated to assert the new leniency. Verified: the two
crashers now render, core + Flutter suites green.

## Closing order (highest value first)
1. **G4 + G5** — never crash on a bad span (skip degenerate / dangling spans).
2. **G3** — handle `<slur type="continue">` in the MusicXML reader.
3. **G1** — embed the SMuFL metadata in the CLI so the released binary renders.
4. **G2** — folds into the C6 multi-part effort (other worktree).
