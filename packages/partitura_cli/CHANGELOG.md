# Changelog

## 0.4.1-dev.1 (in progress)

## 0.4.0 (2026-07-13)

First tagged release. The `partitura` CLI: inspect scores; convert between
MusicXML / `.mxl` / MEI / `**kern` / MIDI / MuseScore / the `.gp` tablature
family / ABC (plus LilyPond export); render to SVG or PNG (notation or tab); and
optical music recognition (`omr`) routing three CrispEmbed engines
(Sheet Music Transformer, Polyphonic-TrOMR, Flova) through one command, with
full-page segmentation (`--page`) and model auto-download by name. The OMR
pipeline is also exposed as a reusable library (`package:partitura_cli/omr.dart`).
