# Guitar Pro test fixtures

These are small, technique-focused Guitar Pro files used as read-path
regression fixtures for partitura's importers (GP3/GP4/GP5 binary,
GP6 `.gpx`, GP7/8 `.gp`).

## Provenance & license

The files are vendored from the [alphaTab](https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab)
project's test corpus:

Only trivial, authored technique demos are vendored here (notes, chords,
bends, slides, hammer-ons, harmonics, dead notes) — no real songs. If you
